# 🍊 Orange Compiler™
The Orange Compiler™ is a simple compiler used alongside the Orange Language™ to teach the inner workings of a compiler in a simple and enjoyable manner. It has a small hint of data analysis as an added bonus.

# 📝 Checkpoints
Checkpoints are given by our professor, although they can change during the semester and they are more like 'symbolic' checkpoints to help us complete the project. These checkpoints represent the core components of the compiler. It is strongly recommended to follow the order of the checkpoints since they follow the class syllabus and the compiler is built in a secuential manner (cannot skip to a further component without finishing previous ones).

### ⚠️ Checkpoint \#0
- Project proposal
- Token list
- Syntax diagrams

### ❌ Checkpoint \#1: Lexical and Syntactical Analysis

### ❌ Checkpoint \#2: Basic variable semantics
- Procedure directory
- Variable table

### ❌ Checkpoint \#3: Expression semantics
- Semantic cube
- Code generation for arithmetic expressions and secuential statutes
    - Assignment
    - Read
    - Write
    - Etc.

### ❌ Checkpoint \#4: Code generation for conditional statutes
- Decisions
- Cycles

### ❌ Checkpoint \#5: Code generation for functions

### ❌ Checkpoint \#6: Memory map for virtual machine
- Execution of arithmetic expressions

- Execution of conditional statutes

### ❌ Checkpoint \#8: First version of documentation
- For a specific section
    - Code generation
    - Virtual machine
